# Life_or_Death_Python_GUI
Life_or_Death_Python_GUI Life_Or_Death_Pyhton_GUI This is a Pyhton GUI version of my personal favourite tv show as a kid Do or Die from National Geographic. This show puts in a life or death situation that another person has faces and survived. You have 3 choices and you must make the right call. Also, it gives information so you are learning while having fun. I turned this into a Python GUI game and as you can tell, I am not a ui designer (It is like 2000's Windows) however it is functional and I DO NOT OWN THIS IDEA. MANY OF THE PHOTOS ARE TAKEN FROM THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC!. So, enjoy and see if you will do, or die!  Warnings As you can tell, my english may not be perfect but I hope you can understand the questions! Also the photos are low on quality because I took the photos from the episodes of National Geographic to display the situation better.
